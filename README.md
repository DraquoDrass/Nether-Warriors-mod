## About

This mod allow you to finish Minecraft without exiting the Nether's dimension. When you spawn, a nether portal generate to make sure you don't spawn above the lava. The stronghold will generate at 35 chucks from the 0 0. To locate the stronghold, you have to simply throw an ender eye as for the normal stronghold. You can also use the `/locate nether_stronghold` command. Throwing an ender eye cause a little freeze but don't worry it's "normal".

## Sources

To create this mod I used and modified two existing mods: noverworld [noverworld](https://github.com/logwet/noverworld) by [logwet](https://github.com/logwet) and [Nether-only-mod](https://github.com/0xb01u/Nether-only-mod) by [0xb01u](https://github.com/0xb01u/Nether-only-mod).

## Modifications

### noverworld

I deleted the fact that players get a stuff once spawned. Also, I deleted all things that open the recipe book and than unlock recipes. I finally removed what disable the spawn invulnerability.

### Nether-only-mod

I changed the generating distance of the stronghold from 50 tp 35. I also change the spawner type in the portal romm (was blaze, changed to magma cube).
